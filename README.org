#+TITLE: A StarPU Backend for Petalisp

This library accelerates Petalisp programs by converting them to C++ and
CUDA code and scheduling them with the StarPU task scheduling framework.

** Installation and Usage
Simply clone this repository into a path that can be located by your Lisp
implementation.  If you use quicklisp, the following line should work:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/marcoheisig/Petalisp.starpu-backend ~/quicklisp/local-projects/starpu-backend
#+END_SRC

You should now be able to load the system with ASDF:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(asdf:load-system "petalisp.starpu-backend")
#+END_SRC

The final step is to install the StarPU backend as Petalisp's default
backend:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setf petalisp:*backend* (petalisp.starpu-backend:make-starpu-backend))
#+END_SRC

That's it, you successfully ported all your Petalisp programs to C++, CUDA,
and StarPU :)
